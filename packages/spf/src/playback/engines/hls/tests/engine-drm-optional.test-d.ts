/**
 * Type-level guard on DRM's **droppability**: that a composition can omit the DRM behaviors and carry none of their
 * slots.
 *
 * Why a type test rather than an assertion in a runtime test: the guarantee is about what the composition's inferred
 * state/context shapes contain, which is exactly what `createComposition`'s key-union inference decides. A slot leaking
 * into the DRM-free shape means some always-composed behavior started declaring it — the failure mode this pins, and
 * one no runtime assertion can see.
 *
 * The byte guarantee this protects (91% of DRM's cost recovered, ~248 B residue) rests on the same property: every DRM
 * module is reachable only through `setupMediaKeys` / `exchangeLicenses` and the two DRM-aware config defaults, so a
 * composition omitting them tree-shakes the rest. Keep it that way — see
 * `internal/design/spf/features/drm-support.md`.
