/**
 * The seam `resolve-track` uses to report conditions discovered in a freshly parsed media playlist.
 *
 * Injected rather than baked in so `resolve-track` stays free of format and policy knowledge: it parses and commits,
 * and whatever the composition wants noticed about the result is this function's business. Which conditions matter, and
 * which codes they carry, therefore vary per composition — a provider that never ships MPEG-TS can drop that check, and
 * future playlist-derived notices (LL-HLS or DVR support that's partial rather than absent) attach here without
 * touching the resolver.
 *
 * Reported **per rendition, as it resolves**, which is why these are causes and not verdicts: one rendition being
 * unplayable doesn't make the source unplayable. The verdict is `track-switching`'s, which reports
 * `SVTA_NO_SUPPORTED_{VIDEO,AUDIO}_TRACK` when a type's candidates actually empty. Keeping the two apart is what lets a
 * mixed source — some renditions encrypted or MPEG-TS, others playable — log its causes and still play.
