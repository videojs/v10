/**
 * Recover an effect that wrote a signal one of its own dependencies reads.
 *
 * When an effect body writes a signal that an intermediate computed in its own dependency graph consumes (e.g. a
 * track-selection effect writing the selection slot a candidate-set computed consults), the graph can't tell the
 * effect: the write marks the intermediate dirty, but the effect is the in-flight consumer, so no watcher notification
 * fires — and the effect finishes the run _clean but stale_. Worse, every later external change routed through that
 * intermediate is deduped against its standing dirty flag, so the effect never hears about those either (the
 * lost-wakeup).
 *
 * Pulling each source once after the run closes the hole: a dirtied intermediate recomputes and its dirty flag clears,
 * so the _next_ change through it propagates and wakes the effect normally. The guarantee is liveness, not immediacy —
 * the effect is deliberately not re-run just because it wrote into its own graph (that would double-run every writing
 * effect); it catches up on the next genuine change. Sources that are clean, or whose recomputation is equals-gated to
 * the same value, cost a cached read and notify no one.

 * contract as Preact Signals, Maverick Signals, and Svelte 5 $effect.
