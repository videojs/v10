# Legacy skin gaps

This file tracks observable behavior in `packages/skins/src` that is not yet implemented in VJSC. Remove an entry once it is implemented and verified for every affected skin, target, and styling output.

## RTL control layout

- Source: `caf179b83` / #2281
- Gap: VJSC handles menu direction, submenu motion, and chevrons, but its control regions and time groups do not yet preserve the legacy skins' physical control order under `dir="rtl"`.
- Affected: Default and Minimal skins; HTML and React targets; CSS and Tailwind outputs.
- Recommendation: Add `:dir(rtl)` layout rules to the current wrapper-free control regions and time groups, then add RTL cases to the VJSC skin matrix before removing this entry.
