I recently filmed a series of [HTML5 video tutorials](http://goo.gl/y0SZb) for Lynda.com, a really great service for online training. It was a great experience, and the videos are now available for viewing. You can get a [7-day free trial here](http://www.lynda.com/promo/trial/Default.aspx?lpk35=1833&utm_medium=affiliate&utm_source=ldc_affiliate&utm_content=655&utm_campaign=CD3175&bid=655&aid=CD3175&opt=) and check them out. Let me know if they&rsquo;re helpful at all.
