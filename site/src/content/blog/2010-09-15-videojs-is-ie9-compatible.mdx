After an initial test, VideoJS works with the new [Internet Explorer 9 preview](http://ie.microsoft.com/testdrive/). Great news, and a little surprising considering the CSS layout of the controls, and the general nature of IE. Other VideoJS site layout stuff seems to break, but for now as long as the player works I&rsquo;m happy.

If you find differently let me know (along with any info that might be helpful).
