title: v10 Roadmap
description: Timeline and milestones for Video.js v10 rebuild and the future of v8
---

Video.js v10 is a complete rebuild from the ground up, designed to be more modular, framework-flexible, and aligned with modern web development practices.

## Current versions

### Version 8

- Maintained with bug fixes and critical security patches only
- No new features will be planned
- Community contributions still welcome

### Version 9

- Reserved only for urgent API-breaking changes that cannot be avoided
- Acts as a stopgap between v8 and the new v10 rebuild

## October 30, 2025: Technical preview


**First public look** at Video.js v10, rebuilt from the ground up.

**Goal:** Get feedback from early adopters and plugin authors.

**What to expect:**
- Limited feature set
- Not production-ready
- Existing plugins and integrations will not work with v10
- Developers encouraged to check it out and give feedback

## February 2026: v10 Beta Release

Wider testing release to the community.

**Core feature parity target:**
- Basic control set (play, pause, seek, volume, fullscreen)
- Adaptive streaming support via existing community engines
- No plugin migrations yet, without plugin author contribution

**What to expect:**
- Close to stable, but API changes are still possible
- Intended for experimental adoption in real-world projects
- Developers encouraged to try it out and report issues

## Mid-2026: v10 GA Release

**Stable release** of Video.js v10

**Feature targets:**
- Core feature parity with v8 in terms of fundamentals
- Feature parity with Media Chrome, Vidstack, Plyr, and Mux Player
- Community encouraged to begin full reintegration projects
- Plugin ecosystem migration begins in earnest

**Engine development focus:**
- Lightweight adaptive streaming
- MoQ (Media over QUIC) support

## Late-2026: Feature parity with v8 Contrib

**Extended feature parity** with Video.js "contrib" plugins:
- Ads integration
- Analytics support
- Further community plugin migration dependent on contributions

## End-of-life plan for Video.js v8

### Mid-2026
- v8/v9 moved to "video.js-legacy" repository and package
- Hosted CDN copies will remain available

### 2027 and beyond
- Security patches only
- Community contributions de-prioritized
