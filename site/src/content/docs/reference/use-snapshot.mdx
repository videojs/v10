description: Hook to subscribe to a State container's current value

import UtilReference from "@/components/docs/api-reference/UtilReference.astro";

## Import

```tsx
import { useSnapshot } from '@videojs/store/react';
```

## Usage

`useSnapshot` subscribes to a `State` container and returns its current value, re-rendering when the value changes. It has two overloads:

**Full state** -- returns the entire state object.

```tsx
function Display({ state }) {
  const value = useSnapshot(state);
  return <span>{value.count}</span>;
}
```

**With selector** -- returns a derived value from the state, re-rendering only when the selected value changes. Pass a custom comparator as the third argument when needed.

```tsx
function Count({ state }) {
  const count = useSnapshot(state, (s) => s.count);
  return <span>{count}</span>;
}
```

### State containers vs stores

A `State` container is a reactive primitive that holds an object value and notifies subscribers on change. Stores are built on top of `State` containers but add features, actions, and lifecycle.

| Hook | Input | Subscribes to |
|------|-------|---------------|
| `useSnapshot` | `State<T>` | Raw state container |
| `useStore` | Store instance | Store-backed state with features |

Use `useSnapshot` when working with standalone `State` containers outside the player store system -- for example, custom state in component libraries. For player state, use `usePlayer` or `useStore`.

`useSnapshot` is built on `useSelector` and uses `shallowEqual` by default. The HTML equivalent is `SnapshotController`.
