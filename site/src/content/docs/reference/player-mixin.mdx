## Import

```ts
import { PlayerMixin } from '@videojs/html';
```

## Usage

`PlayerMixin` combines `ProviderMixin` and `ContainerMixin` into a single mixin. The resulting class both owns the player store and auto-attaches media elements, making it a complete player element.

```ts
import { createPlayer, features, MediaElement } from '@videojs/html';

const { PlayerMixin } = createPlayer({ features: features.video });

class MyPlayer extends PlayerMixin(MediaElement) {
  connectedCallback() {
    super.connectedCallback();
    // this.store is the player store instance
  }
}

customElements.define('my-player', MyPlayer);
```

### Choose your approach

| Approach | When to use |
|----------|-------------|
| `PlayerElement` | Simplest setup. Register and use directly -- no custom class needed. |
| `PlayerMixin(Base)` | Custom player element with additional lifecycle logic or methods. |
| `ProviderMixin` + `ContainerMixin` | Provider and container are separate elements (e.g., store owner is a layout shell, media lives in a content region). |

`PlayerMixin` is equivalent to `ProviderMixin(ContainerMixin(Base))`. It creates the store on connect, observes the DOM for `<video>` or `<audio>` children, and publishes the store to descendant elements via context.

### PlayerElement vs PlayerMixin

For the simplest setup, use the pre-composed `PlayerElement` from `createPlayer`:

```ts
const { PlayerElement } = createPlayer({ features: features.video });
customElements.define('video-player', PlayerElement);
```

Use `PlayerMixin` when you need to add custom behavior:

```ts
class MyPlayer extends PlayerMixin(MediaElement) {
  connectedCallback() {
    super.connectedCallback();
    this.store.subscribe(() => {
      // Custom logic on state changes
    });
  }
}
```
