## Introduction

Video.js is a community-built, free and open source HTML5 video player framework. This privacy policy describes how the Video.js website at v10.videojs.org handles information when you visit our site.

## Information We Don't Collect

We are committed to protecting your privacy. This website does **not**:

- Set advertising or tracking cookies for third-party ad networks
- Share your data with third-party services for advertising or cross-site tracking purposes
- Collect personal information unless you voluntarily provide it
- Track your browsing behavior across other websites

## Information We May Collect

Like most websites, our web servers may automatically collect standard technical information including:

- IP addresses (for security and server administration)
- Browser type and version
- Referring website addresses
- Pages requested and timestamps

This information is used solely for maintaining the website's functionality, security, and performance. It is not used for tracking or profiling visitors.

## Analytics and Tracking

To help us improve the Video.js website and documentation, we use Netlify Web Analytics to understand aggregate traffic patterns.

**How this works:**
- We review aggregate usage metrics such as page views and top content paths.
- We use this information to improve documentation quality and site usability.
- We do not run a client-side product analytics SDK on this site.

**What this is not used for:**
- Advertising targeting
- Cross-site behavioral profiling

## Open Source and GitHub

Video.js is hosted on GitHub, and our documentation may link to GitHub repositories and issues. When you interact with GitHub (such as submitting issues or pull requests), you are subject to [GitHub's Privacy Policy](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement).

## Cookies and Similar Technologies

This website uses cookies and browser localStorage for security, authentication, and documentation preferences.

### Essential Security and Authentication Cookies

These cookies are required for secure authentication flows related to Mux uploader access:

- **`state`** - Short-lived OAuth state token used for CSRF protection during sign-in.
- **`session`** - Encrypted, HTTP-only session cookie used to keep authenticated sessions active.
- **Duration:** `state` is short-lived (up to 10 minutes). `session` expires after inactivity (up to 2 days).
- **Purpose:** Securely authenticate access to authenticated Mux upload features.

### Functional Preference Storage

We store documentation display preferences so the site can remember your preferred view:

- **Cookie:** `vjs_docs_framework` remembers your preferred docs framework (HTML, React, or React Native).
- **localStorage:** `vjs_docs_style_<framework>` remembers your preferred style for each framework.
- **Duration:** `vjs_docs_framework` is set for up to 1 year. localStorage values persist until you clear browser storage.
- **Purpose:** Show documentation and code examples in your preferred format.

### Analytics Measurement

We use Netlify Web Analytics for aggregate site measurement. This measurement is not used for ad targeting or cross-site profiling by us.

## Children's Privacy

Our website does not specifically target children under 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.

## Data Retention

**Server Logs:** Server logs containing technical information may be retained for security and operational purposes for a reasonable period, typically not exceeding 12 months.

**Analytics Data:** Netlify Web Analytics data retention and availability are managed by Netlify according to their product settings and policies. We use analytics data in aggregate form to improve the website and documentation.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated "Last updated" date.
