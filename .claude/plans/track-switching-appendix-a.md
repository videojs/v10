# Appendix A — working draft

Scratch doc for the "why a filter + sort pipeline isn't enough" appendix of
[`track-switching-architecture.md`](../../internal/design/spf/track-switching-architecture.md).
We iterate here and fold back in as Appendix A once settled; the live design doc keeps its
current (in-progress) Appendix A untouched in the meantime.

## Shared example

Both options run on **one** track set and **one** rule set:

- **Option 1** — `filter` means *forbidden-or-not-preferred* (the two conflate).
- **Option 2** — `filter` means *forbidden*; the *preferred*-vs-*allowed* distinction is pushed onto sort order.

The only thing that varies between the two is one environmental assumption — **whether the browser
can decode E-AC-3** — which changes what `capabilityProbing` forbids. Tracks and the rule definitions
are otherwise identical.

### Tracks

Audio renditions for one source. Spanish is the user's preferred language and ships as E-AC-3
(surround, runs hotter than AAC); English ships as AAC.

```ts
const tracks = [
  // Spanish — E-AC-3
  { id: 'esLowEac',  lang: 'es', codec: 'eac3', bitrate: 192 },
  { id: 'esHighEac', lang: 'es', codec: 'eac3', bitrate: 384 },
  { id: 'esMaxEac',  lang: 'es', codec: 'eac3', bitrate: 640 },
  // English — AAC
  { id: 'enLowAac',  lang: 'en', codec: 'aac',  bitrate: 64  },
  { id: 'enHighAac', lang: 'en', codec: 'aac',  bitrate: 256 },
  { id: 'enMaxAac',  lang: 'en', codec: 'aac',  bitrate: 512 },
];
```

### Rules

Three rules, in priority order (rule 1 highest). Each is a general track-selection *concern* — what
it's trying to achieve, not how it's expressed. The options below take these same concerns and
combine them in different ways; only the concerns are shared.

| # | Rule | Category | The concern |
|---|------|----------|-------------|
| 1 | `preferredLanguage` | user-intent | The user picked a language: want every track in it; no opinion on bitrate; tracks in other languages are acceptable but not wanted. |
| 2 | `capabilityProbing` | system | Some tracks are unplayable (undecodable codec, unsupported DRM, …) and must be excluded; no preference among the playable rest. |
| 3 | `abr` | system | Throughput-based quality: of the tracks that fit the current throughput estimate, want the highest quality; over-throughput tracks are usable only as a fallback, least-over first. |

### Applying the rules

A concrete pick depends on the playback **context** — three facts, one per rule:

- **Preferred language** — Spanish.
- **E-AC-3 decodable?** — yes or no (the one fact we change to discuss the differences).
- **Throughput estimate** — ~300 kbps, so `esLowEac`, `enLowAac`, `enHighAac` fit and `esHighEac`, `esMaxEac`, `enMaxAac` are over.

Given that context, each rule wants:

- **`preferredLanguage`** wants the Spanish renditions `esLowEac`, `esHighEac`, `esMaxEac` (no order among them); English is acceptable but not wanted.
- **`capabilityProbing`** excludes the three Spanish renditions if E-AC-3 isn't decodable, otherwise excludes nothing; either way it has no preference/order among whatever remains playable.
- **`abr`** wants the fitting renditions best-quality first — `enHighAac`, `esLowEac`, `enLowAac` — and treats the over-throughput ones as a last-resort fallback, least-over first — `esHighEac`, `enMaxAac`, `esMaxEac`.

## Option 1 — `filter` means "forbidden-or-not-preferred"

Here a rule is a plain **keep/drop filter** — it returns the tracks it keeps, recording *what*
survived but not *why* each other track was dropped. So it can't tell "do not play"
(`capabilityProbing` dropping an undecodable track) from "prefer not to play" (`preferredLanguage`
passing over English). When those dropped sets overlap, the filter must either fail on playable
content or play unplayable content.

Assume **E-AC-3 is not decodable**, so `capabilityProbing` drops all three Spanish renditions.

### A plain filter — keep/drop only

Each rule in isolation returns what it keeps; the "why" lives only in the comments, not the data:

```ts
preferredLanguage(tracks)  // → [esLowEac, esHighEac, esMaxEac]   drop English (user prefers Spanish)
capabilityProbing(tracks)  // → [enLowAac, enHighAac, enMaxAac]   drop the E-AC-3 tracks (here, all the Spanish ones)
abr(tracks)                // → [enHighAac, esLowEac, enLowAac]   drop the over-throughput tracks; sort the rest
```

Composing = chain the filters, each narrowing what's left:

```ts
let results = tracks;
results = preferredLanguage(results);  // → [esLowEac, esHighEac, esMaxEac]   drops English
results = capabilityProbing(results);  // → []                                drops Spanish (undecodable)
results = abr(results);                // → []                                nothing left

// results is empty. English was dropped back at preferredLanguage, with no record it was only
// "prefer not to play" (safe to relax) while Spanish was "do not play" — so we can't recover:
//   • give up   → "no playable audio"           ❌  (English was fine)
//   • undo all  → may play undecodable Spanish   ❌  (decode error)
```

### The structured output — the reason survives

Keep the *why*: `forbidden` ("do not play") is distinct from merely-not-`preferred` ("prefer not to play").

```ts
preferredLanguage  // { preferred: [esLowEac, esHighEac, esMaxEac] }    Spanish preferred; English just not-preferred
capabilityProbing  // { forbidden: [esLowEac, esHighEac, esMaxEac] }    "do not play" — undecodable
abr                // { preferred: [enHighAac, esLowEac, enLowAac], allowed: [esHighEac, enMaxAac, esMaxEac] }

forbidden = [esLowEac, esHighEac, esMaxEac]   // do not play (union of every forbidden set)
eligible  = [enLowAac, enHighAac, enMaxAac]   // English survives — not forbidden, just not-preferred
pick      = enHighAac                         // ✅ Spanish undecodable → abr's best fitting English
```

**Takeaway:** the plain filter keeps only *what* survived and discards *why each track didn't*, so an
empty result can't relax "prefer not to play" (English → recover) while still respecting "do not
play" (Spanish). Recording the reason — `forbidden` vs merely-not-`preferred` — is what lets
composition fall back to English instead of failing or playing something undecodable.

## Option 2 — `filter` means "forbidden"; preferred-vs-allowed via sort

Option 1's fix: make `filter` *always* mean `forbidden` (hard), and put the softer
preferred-vs-allowed distinction in **sort order** — each rule sorts the tracks it doesn't forbid,
front = preferred, back = merely tolerated. Assume **E-AC-3 is decodable**, so `capabilityProbing`
forbids nothing and all six renditions are playable.

The two opinionated rules now disagree about order: `preferredLanguage` wants every Spanish rendition
ahead of every English one; `abr` wants `enHighAac` (its best fitting rendition) ahead of `esLowEac`
— because the only fitting Spanish rendition, `esLowEac` (192), is lower-bitrate than the best
fitting English, `enHighAac` (256). Both are right, about *different axes*. The correct pick is
`esLowEac` (Spanish and fitting).

### A filter + sort — tier via sort position

Each rule sorts what it tolerates; "preferred" is just "nearer the front":

```ts
preferredLanguage(tracks)  // sorts → [esLowEac, esHighEac, esMaxEac, enLowAac, enHighAac, enMaxAac]   Spanish first; bitrate order arbitrary
capabilityProbing(tracks)  // keeps → all six (forbids nothing; no sort opinion)
abr(tracks)                // sorts → [enHighAac, esLowEac, enLowAac, esHighEac, enMaxAac, esMaxEac]   fitting best-first, then over-throughput
```

Composing = chain the sorts, each re-sorting the running list — and because a sort returns a *total*
order, the last rule's sort wins outright:

```ts
let results = tracks;
results = preferredLanguage(results);  // → [esLowEac, esHighEac, esMaxEac, enLowAac, enHighAac, enMaxAac]   Spanish to front; bitrate order arbitrary
results = capabilityProbing(results);  // → unchanged   forbids nothing
results = abr(results);                // → [enHighAac, esLowEac, enLowAac, esHighEac, enMaxAac, esMaxEac]   re-sorts by fit → enHighAac to front

// pick = results[0] = enHighAac ❌ — abr sorted last and clobbered preferredLanguage's "Spanish first",
// so the user asked for Spanish and got English. The Spanish ladder doesn't save it — the best FITTING
// track is still English (enHighAac 256 > esLowEac 192). But abr only won because it sorted *last*…
```

#### But can't we just reorder the rules?

`abr` only "won" because it sorted **last** — and chaining sorts is last-writer-wins, so the
last-applied rule is effectively the *primary* sort key. We applied the rules in priority order, which
puts our highest-priority rule (`preferredLanguage`) *first* — the weakest spot. That's backwards. Flip
it so `preferredLanguage` sorts last:

```ts
let results = tracks;
results = abr(results);                // → [enHighAac, esLowEac, enLowAac, esHighEac, enMaxAac, esMaxEac]   quality order
results = capabilityProbing(results);  // → unchanged   forbids nothing
results = preferredLanguage(results);  // → [esLowEac, esHighEac, esMaxEac, enHighAac, enLowAac, enMaxAac]   Spanish to front

pick = results[0] = esLowEac   // ✅ Spanish and fitting — the cross-language switch is gone
```

`preferredLanguage` only reorders by language — a **stable** sort — so it floats Spanish to the front
*without disturbing* `abr`'s order within each language. Chaining the two stable sorts is just a
lexicographic sort: **language primary, `abr` quality secondary**. For this example it genuinely works
— `esLowEac` is picked, and `abr`'s ranking survives as the within-language tiebreaker.

So is filter + sort fine after all, as long as we order the rules right? For this scenario, yes. The
strict, global priority that chaining stable sorts imposes — whatever sorts last wins unconditionally —
is exactly what we want here: language *always* outranks throughput, so every Spanish rendition,
including the over-throughput `esHighEac` and `esMaxEac`, sits above every English one. That's correct.
The user asked for Spanish, so we play Spanish — rebuffering if we must — and only drop to English once
no Spanish rendition is left.

### The structured output — the tiers survive

A rule emits `preferred` (and `forbidden` where it applies); its leftover is the implicit, unsorted
`allowed`. A rule spells `allowed` out explicitly only when it ranks that leftover, as `abr` does for
its over-throughput tracks. The composer keeps the **tier** (pessimistic) separate from the **order**
(from the rules' rankings):

```ts
preferredLanguage  // { preferred: [esLowEac, esHighEac, esMaxEac] }              → English implicitly allowed (no bitrate ranking)
capabilityProbing  // { }                                                          → forbids nothing; no preference, transparent to tiering
abr                // { preferred: [enHighAac, esLowEac, enLowAac], preferredRanked: true,
                   //   allowed: [esHighEac, enMaxAac, esMaxEac] }                 → over-throughput tier, ranked ascending

// composite TIER — pessimistic (preferred only if every rule that voices a preference prefers it):
//   esLowEac             → preferred   (preferredLanguage ✓ and abr ✓; capabilityProbing voices none)
//   enHighAac, enLowAac  → allowed     (abr prefers them, but preferredLanguage only allows English)
//   esHighEac, esMaxEac  → allowed     (preferredLanguage prefers them, but abr only allows over-throughput)
//   enMaxAac             → allowed     (both rules only allow it)
preferred = [esLowEac]
allowed   = [enHighAac, enLowAac, esHighEac, enMaxAac, esMaxEac]   // ORDER from abr: fitting (enHighAac>enLowAac), then over-throughput

pick = first preferred → esLowEac   // ✅ Spanish & fitting — the one rendition both rules prefer
```

`preferredLanguage`'s silence on English is what demotes it: a track is composite-`preferred` only if
*every* rule that voices a preference prefers it — so `enHighAac` is demoted (abr prefers it,
`preferredLanguage` only allows English), and `esHighEac`/`esMaxEac` are demoted too
(`preferredLanguage` prefers them, abr only allows the over-throughput rungs). Only `esLowEac` —
Spanish *and* fitting — is preferred by both, so it's the pick. The cross-language switch never
happens: `esLowEac` beats `enHighAac` by **tier**, even though abr ranks `enHighAac` higher by
**order**.

In the `allowed` fallback the over-throughput Spanish (`esHighEac`, `esMaxEac`) appears demoted below
fitting English — seemingly a switch to English rather than a rebuffer. But the fall-through still
favors the language: with no Spanish rung fitting, it takes an over-throughput Spanish over English.
Spanish wins whether or not one of its rungs fits.

**Takeaway:** making `filter` mean only `forbidden` fixes Option 1's hard/soft conflation, but a
single sort position still can't carry preferred-vs-allowed. The two opinionated rules' tier-cuts
(language's Spanish-≫-English, abr's fitting-≫-over-throughput) fall in different places, and a flat
order holds only one. Worse, a sort forces every rule to *totally order* even tracks it has no opinion
on, so chaining is last-writer-wins — either abr clobbers the language scope (picks English) or
`preferredLanguage`'s phantom bitrate order clobbers abr's ranking. The structured model sidesteps
both: `allowed` is the implicit, unsorted leftover (or spelled out when a rule ranks it), the **tier**
composes pessimistically, and the **order** comes from the rules' rankings — so language scopes the
tier while abr ranks within it.
