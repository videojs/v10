# SPF Work Breakdown & Estimation

This directory contains the work breakdown structure, estimation, and tracking for the Stream Processing Framework (SPF) initiative.

## Documents

- `categories.md` - High-level feature categories and capabilities
- `triage.md` - T-shirt sizing and initial prioritization
- `breakdown.md` - Detailed story point breakdown for prioritized work
- `roadmap.md` - Incremental delivery waves and milestones
- `issues/` - Draft GitHub issues ready to create

## Process

1. **Define Categories** - Identify broad feature areas and capabilities
2. **T-shirt Size** - Quick XS/S/M/L/XL/XXL sizing for triage
3. **Prioritize** - Impact × Effort matrix (P0/P1/P2/P3/P4)
4. **Detail Breakdown** - Convert to story points (1-21) with acceptance criteria
5. **Create Issues** - Generate GitHub issues/tasks for tracking

## Estimation Scales

### T-Shirt Sizing
- **XS** (1-2 days) - Single function, minimal dependencies
- **S** (2-5 days) - Small feature, straightforward
- **M** (1-2 weeks) - Medium feature, some complexity
- **L** (2-4 weeks) - Large feature, requires design
- **XL** (1-2 months) - Major feature, significant architecture
- **XXL** (2+ months) - Epic, needs breakdown

### Story Points (Fibonacci)
- **1** - Trivial (fix typo, update docs)
- **2** - Simple (add test, small refactor)
- **3** - Straightforward (implement helper, fix bug)
- **5** - Moderate (feature component, integration)
- **8** - Complex (cross-cutting change, new abstraction)
- **13** - Very complex (major feature, significant risk)
- **21+** - Epic (needs breakdown)

## Priority Levels
- **P0** - Blockers (must have for MVP/launch)
- **P1** - High priority (critical for quality/performance)
- **P2** - Medium priority (important but can defer)
- **P3** - Low priority (nice to have, future enhancement)
- **P4** - Deferred (out of scope, backlog)

## Next Steps

Start by populating `categories.md` with your vision for SPF features and capabilities.
