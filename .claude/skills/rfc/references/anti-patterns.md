# RFC Anti-Patterns

Common mistakes to avoid.

## Checklist

Before submitting, verify:

- [ ] **Problem before solution** — Don't jump into API design without context
- [ ] **Concepts explained first** — Don't reference terms before defining them
- [ ] **Code illustrates ideas** — Not implementation details
- [ ] **Scannable structure** — Lists and whitespace, not walls of text
- [ ] **Single source of truth** — Explain once, link elsewhere
- [ ] **Every decision has "why"** — Include alternatives considered
- [ ] **Decisions updated in place** — Don't append v1/v2/v3 entries
- [ ] **Examples match proposal** — Update when design changes
- [ ] **Focused scope** — Future work in Open Questions, not main content
- [ ] **Active voice** — "Proxy updates state" not "state will be updated"

## Quick Reference

| Anti-Pattern            | Fix                                    |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Solution before problem | Start with the pain point              |
| Assumed context         | Introduce concepts in order needed     |
| Implementation details  | Show usage, not internals              |
| Dense paragraphs        | Use lists, code blocks, whitespace     |
| Duplicated content      | One canonical location, link to it     |
| Missing rationale       | Decision + Alternatives + Rationale    |
| Appending decisions     | Update existing entry, note evolution  |
| Stale examples          | Keep minimal, verify before finalizing |
| Scope creep             | One proposal per RFC                   |
| Passive voice           | Be specific about who does what        |
